Trunk Based Development

##Branches
The repo only has one long lived branch, main. The codeset reflected on main is hosted on the staging site, and pushes to this branch trigger an automatic deployment into staging. 

##Tags
There is a production tag on the codeset, and this represents the current codeset in production. Allocating this tag to a commit upgrades the code deployed into production.
